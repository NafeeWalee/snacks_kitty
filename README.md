### SnacksKitty 
(Repo is very old) 

🐱 Snackskitty is a playful, pet-focused mobile app inspired by the UI/UX of Foodpanda, reimagined for cat owners. The platform allows users to browse, order, and schedule deliveries for cat food and services, all in a familiar, intuitive layout.

Originally built as a passion project, Snackskitty offers a fun twist on food delivery apps, tailored for feline companions. Designed with attention to cart flow, shop selection, delivery/pick-up modes, and store discounts.

📱 Screenshots available below to preview the interface and user journey.
